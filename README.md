makes a png of an ulam spiral

## To Use:
Assuming you have cargo installed, clone the repository and navigate to its base directory.
Then, simply perform the run command for cargo in the command line with the following optional arguements:

`cargo run [n] [destination] `

The ulam spiral produced will be an nxn png named "ulam_spiral{n}.png", where n is 200 by default. 
If no other destination is specified, the image will be saved in the local directory.
